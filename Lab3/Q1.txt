The technique of 1D convolution is employed to detect edges in an image by sliding a small filter along a singular dimension, often either horizontally or vertically. This filter is specifically crafted to identify alterations in pixel intensity and exhibits strong responsiveness to abrupt transitions from low to high intensity values. As this filter traverses the image, it undergoes a computation process where its coefficients are multiplied with corresponding pixel values at each position, with the results being summed. Consequently, a novel signal is generated, drawing attention to regions where notable changes in intensity occur. This signal effectively marks the edges present within the image. Through the application of suitable thresholding to this signal, the identified edges can be accentuated, proving beneficial in diverse image processing endeavors such as object detection and outlining boundaries.
