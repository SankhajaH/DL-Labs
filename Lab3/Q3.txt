An increase in the number of epochs can sometimes lead to a rise in validation error due to overfitting. When a model is trained for an extended number of epochs, it can become overly tailored to the training data, even capturing irrelevant noise and outliers. Consequently, the model's performance might deteriorate when tested on new, unseen validation data. To mitigate this issue, various techniques such as early stopping, dropout, and regularization can be implemented. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation error and stopping the training process when it begins to rise, thus preventing the model from overfitting. Regularization techniques, like incorporating penalty terms into the loss function, help rein in the model's complexity and discourage it from fitting noise.

Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) exhibits faster convergence compared to batch Gradient Descent (GD) by capitalizing on the strengths of both methods. Batch GD computes gradients based on the entire dataset, leading to steady but sluggish updates. On the other hand, pure SGD updates based on individual data points, resulting in erratic updates and slow convergence. Mini-batch SGD strikes a balance by utilizing small subsets of the data, blending frequent updates with reduced noise. This enables effective utilization of parallel processing, accelerating convergence and enabling the algorithm to discover an improved solution in less time.
